<div class="row">
<p>If you know how to create links in Markdown, you can create images, too. The
  syntax is nearly the same.</p>
<p>The difference is that an image is prefaced with an exclamation point ( <code>!</code> ), followed by the same two brackets, and a pair of parentheses containing the image URL. Within the image brackets, you can place some "alt text," which is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.</p>

<p>In the box below, turn the link to an image, and fill out the alt text brackets
   to say "<strong>An image of James B. Hunt Library</strong>":</p>
  <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>

  <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>

<div class="toBeRevealed">
  <hr>
  <p>You can also reference local image files for use in websites. For example, if you keep the images you use on your site in a folder labeled images your link would look like this:</p>
  <xmp>
    ![This is a local image](/images/local-image.jpg)
  </xmp>
  <a class="btn btn-lg btn-success" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/lesson/5">On to the next lesson!</a>
</div>
