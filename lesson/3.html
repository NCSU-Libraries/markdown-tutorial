<div class="row">
<p>We'll now learn how to make links to other web sites on the world wide web.</p>

<p>To create a link, you wrap the link text that you want to appear for the link in brackets ( <code>[ ]</code> ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( <code>( )</code> ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown:</p>

  <xmp>
  [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)
  </xmp>

<p>In the box below, make a link to www.google.com, with link text that says "Search for it."</p>
  <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>

  <hr>
  <p>You can make headings links too!</p>
  <p>For this next tutorial, make the text a heading two, and turn the entire phrase into a link that points to www.lib.ncsu.edu/news</p>
    <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
</div>

  <p>In addition to traditional links, markdown can also format <em>reference</em> links. As the name implies, the link is actually a reference to another place in the document. This is a great way to use the same link in multiple places in a document Here's an example of what we mean:</p>

  <xmp>
     Here's [a link to something][something].
     Here's [a link to something else][something-else].
     But here is [another link to something][something].

     [something]: www.something.com
     [something-else]: www.somethingelse.com
  </xmp>

  <p>As you can see in the example above we used the 'something' link twice, but only had to enter the url for the link at the bottom of the page, like a reference or citation that you are used to using in other types of writing.</p>

  <p>Reference links don't appear in the rendered Markdown. You define them by providing
    the same tag name wrapped in brackets, followed by a colon, followed by the link.</p>

  <p>In the box below, we've started writing out some reference links. You'll
    need to finish them up! Add the reference links below the text we provided. <strong>[the-library]</strong> should point to <strong>www.lib.ncsu.edu</strong> and <strong>[library-hours]</strong> should point to <strong>www.lib.ncsu.edu/hours</strong></p>
    <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
