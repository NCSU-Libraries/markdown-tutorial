<p>Markdown has several ways of formatting paragraphs.</p>

<p>Let's take a few lines of poetry as an example. Suppose you want to write
text that looks like this:</p>
<p>Do I contradict myself?<br/>
Very well then I contradict myself,<br/>
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)</p>
<p>Now, you might think that simply typing each verse onto its own line would be
  enough to solve the problem:</p>
<xmp>
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
</xmp>
<p>Unfortunately, you'd be wrong! This Markdown would render simply as a single
  straight line.</p>

<p>If you forcefully insert a new line by pressing the return key at the end of each line, markdown will render each like as a separate paragraph, resulting in an extra blank line between each line of text</p>

<p>This is what's known as a <em>hard break</em>; what our poetry asks for is a
<em>soft break</em>. You can accomplish this by inserting two spaces <em>at the end</em> of each
line. This is not possible to see, since spaces are invisible, but it'd look something like this(the dots represent spaces):</p>
<xmp>
Do I contradict myself?路路
Very well then I contradict myself,路路
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
</xmp>

<p>Let's try this technique out. In the box below, insert the necessary number of
spaces to make the poem render correctly:</p>

  <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>

  <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>


<div class="toBeRevealed">
  <hr>
  <p>Et voila! You now know how to make soft breaks in Markdown!</p>
