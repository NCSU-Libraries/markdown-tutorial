<div class="row">
<p>There are two types of lists in HTML, so there are also two in Markdown: unordered and ordered. An unordered list uses bullets and an ordered list uses numbers</p>
<p>To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with
  either an asterisk ( <code>*</code> ) or a dash (<code>-</code>) followed by a space and then the item on the list. Each list item also gets its own line. For example,
  a grocery list in Markdown might look like this:</p>
  <xmp>
* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter
</xmp>
<p>This Markdown list would render into the following bullet points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Salmon</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
</ul>
<p>In the box below, turn the words separated by a comma into a list.</p>

<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>

  <p>An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks. Take a look at this recipe:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Crack three eggs over a bowl</li>
    <li>Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl</li>
    <li>Rub the salmon vigorously with butter</li>
    <li>Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To write that in Markdown, you'd do this:</p>
<xmp>
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl
</xmp>
  <p>Easy, right? It's just like you'd expect a list to look.</p>
  <p>In the box below, turn the rest of the recipe into an ordered list.</p>
    <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
</div>
