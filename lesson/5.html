<div class="row">
<p>A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. For example:</p>
  <blockquote><p>
  "The sin of doing nothing is the
  deadliest of all the seven sins. It has been said that for evil men to accomplish
  their purpose it is only necessary that good men should do nothing."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than"
caret (<code>></code>). For example:
<xmp>
> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In accumsan pharetra
nisi a aliquet. Duis id tellus enim. Etiam id justo eu mi semper vehicula. Suspendisse
velit mi, dictum quis arcu sit amet, efficitur suscipit leo."
</xmp>
</p>

<p>In the box below, turn the words between quotation marks into a blockquote:</p>
  <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>

  <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
