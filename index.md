## What is Markdown?

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text markup language that allows you to quickly and easily add formatting to plain text files. When processed via an application or website it renders html. It can also be used in place of other word processing applications to format text.

 It's quickly becoming the writing standard for
**academics**, **scientists**, **writers**,
and many more.  Websites like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and
[reddit](http://www.reddit.com) use Markdown to style their comments.
